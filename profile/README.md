# EnginOER: Online Educational Resources for Engineers

Open educational resources are great. They are even better when easy to reuse and improve! This GitHub Organization is set up explicitly to make that process better.

In particular, we will use free and open GitHub tools to easily find, explore and resuse open educational materials.

The creator is a civil engineer, but this should be relevant for many engineering and science fields, especially those that rely heavily on physics.
